HTML presentation templates for Mozilla
=======================================

This is the repository with HTML format. View the [sample overview](http://mozilla.github.io/html-presentation-templates/template.html?lang=en-US).

Sample multilingual links:

* [en-US](http://mozilla.github.io/html-presentation-templates/template.html?full=&lang=en-US#shout)
* [zh-CN](http://mozilla.github.io/html-presentation-templates/template.html?full=&lang=zh-CN#shout)
* [zh-TW](http://mozilla.github.io/html-presentation-templates/template.html?full=&lang=zh-TW#shout)
* [ja-JP](http://mozilla.github.io/html-presentation-templates/template.html?full=&lang=ja-JP#shout)

Changes in this version:

* Fullscreen button (as requested by Stormy Peters)
* Overall cleanup of the CSS (different list styles, live CSS code)
* Pressing "N" in fullscreen mode toggles note display
* In list mode, each slide has a "x" button to turn it on and off. This does not persist though, so when you reload your slides, it will make them all active again (TODO I guess)
* Support for multilingual slides, with URLs that update. Toggle the menu option to get the text in your desired language.
* Moved out to a dedicated repository, originally from https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-presentation-templates

Next steps:

* Persist Toggle slides feature

Known issues:

* Slide printing sometimes doesn't work properly
