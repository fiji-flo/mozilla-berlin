# Volunteering for an Open Web

## Short thesis

*The Internet is an integral part of modern lifeâ€”a key component in education,
communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.*
*The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.*
These are the first two principles of the
[Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/3about/manifesto/) and summarize the
motivation behind this talk quite well. How can we contribute to protect the open
web, the platform for our modern digital culture.

## Description

This talk gives an introduction into the Mozilla Community. How we are organized,
structured and financed. What drives us and what do we do.

Mozilla is well known for Firefox, but not so much for the community that drives
us. We call ourselves [Mozillians](https://mozillians.org) and contribute in
various ways to Mozilla's [Mission](https://www.mozilla.org/mission/).

We are working to keep the internet healthy, open and accessible to all. To do
so, we need help! Areas like web literacy, advocacy and participation but also
a lot of innovative technologies are looking for new volunteers to get involved.
We are building the future of the open web exploring technologies like
[servo](https://servo.org), a next generation web rendering engine. At the same
time we are organizing campaigns for a
[better European copyright reform](https://www.changecopyright.org/signup#about).

Dive into the community world of Mozilla and join us protect the open web!
